ACeDB2Java
==========

Java library to connect with ACeDB (A C. elegans DataBase).

This library was born out of a desire to extract data from the ACeDB system which is 
at the core of WormBase (www.wormbase.org).

There is a sample command line project which demonstrates its usage.

This project is by no means meant to be a compete exploration of the
functionality available. It will be up to the code user to explore
the ACeDB saceclient interface (refs. below) to fully exploit the
system.
